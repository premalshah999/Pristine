                  Megha trained as a Physical Therapist and spent two decades
                  watching the same patients return with the same pain — because
                  no one was looking past the symptom. She earned her
                  certification as a Functional Nutritional Counsellor to do
                  the work she always wanted to: <em className="italic-serif">treat the whole person.</em>

                  Her practice today is virtual, rooted in the Institute for
                  Functional Medicine framework, and built on the conviction
                  that almost every chronic condition has an upstream cause
                  worth finding. She works with adults navigating thyroid
                  disease, autoimmunity, gut dysfunction, hormonal imbalances,
                  metabolic stuckness, and the kind of unexplained fatigue that
                  has been dismissed by ten different doctors.

                  Her style is calm, deeply curious, and built around the
                  belief that healing is a partnership. She is not in the
                  business of telling you what to do — she is in the business
                  of helping you understand your own body well enough to make
                  the right decisions for it.
