  {
    title: "Acceptance of Terms",
    body: `By accessing or using this website and scheduling any appointment with Pristine Functional Health, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. If you do not agree, please do not use our services. We reserve the right to update these terms at any time, and continued use of the site constitutes acceptance of any changes.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Nature of Services",
    body: `Pristine Functional Health provides virtual functional health consultations, functional nutrition counseling, and wellness coaching services. These services are educational and supportive in nature. They do not replace diagnosis, treatment, or ongoing care from your licensed medical providers, and they are not a substitute for emergency medical care. Megha Shah is a licensed Physical Therapist (DPT) and Certified Functional Nutritional Counsellor (CFNC). Services are provided within her scope of licensure and certification.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Not a Medical Emergency Service",
    body: `If you are experiencing a medical emergency, call 911 or go to your nearest emergency room immediately. Pristine Functional Health cannot respond to emergencies and is not designed for crisis or acute care situations. Our services are intended for chronic, complex, and lifestyle-related health concerns pursued in a non-emergency context.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Disclaimer",
    body: `Pristine Functional Health does not provide psychotherapy, psychiatric diagnosis, crisis counseling, or emergency mental health services. Functional nutrition and wellness coaching may support the body systems that influence mood, energy, and stress resilience, but they do not replace care from a licensed therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or other mental health professional. If you are in emotional crisis, feel unsafe, or may harm yourself or someone else, call 911 or call or text 988 for the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline in the United States. Do not start, stop, or change psychiatric medication or therapy plans without guidance from the licensed professional managing that care.`,
  },
  {
    title: "FDA Disclaimer",
    body: `Statements on this website, in educational materials, and during wellness sessions have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. Pristine Functional Health does not claim that any nutrition strategy, supplement, protocol, lab review, lifestyle recommendation, food sensitivity kit, or educational resource will diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Products discussed are not represented as FDA-approved treatments unless explicitly stated by the product manufacturer or applicable regulator. Information is provided for educational and wellness purposes only. Always consult a qualified licensed healthcare provider before beginning a supplement, changing medications, delaying medical care, or making significant diet, exercise, or lifestyle changes, especially if you are pregnant, nursing, taking medication, or managing a diagnosed medical condition.`,
  },
  {
    title: "HIPAA Compliance & Confidentiality",
    body: `Pristine Functional Health protects health information using HIPAA-conscious administrative, technical, and physical safeguards. Protected Health Information (PHI) may include intake forms, consultation notes, lab documents you provide, wellness history, payment records tied to care, and communications about your services. PHI is accessed only by Megha Shah and necessary administrative support involved in scheduling, payment, documentation, or care coordination. We use secure platforms when collecting or storing health information, share the minimum necessary information for operational needs, and do not disclose PHI to third parties without written authorization except as permitted or required by law. Where a vendor handles PHI, we use privacy-sensitive systems and business-associate safeguards when applicable. Standard email and text messaging can carry security limits, so sensitive health details should be shared through secure channels whenever available.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Testimonials and Results",
    body: `Testimonials, case examples, and representative patient stories on this website are provided for educational context. Some stories may be composites or edited for privacy, clarity, and length. They are not guarantees of results, and they should not be interpreted as medical claims. Your outcome depends on your health history, consistency, medical care, labs, lifestyle, and other individual factors.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Appointment Scheduling and Cancellation",
    body: `Appointments are scheduled through our online booking system. We ask that you provide at least 24 hours' notice if you need to cancel or reschedule a session. Late cancellations or no-shows may be subject to a cancellation fee as outlined at the time of booking. We reserve the right to refuse service to individuals who repeatedly cancel without adequate notice.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Payment and Refunds",
    body: `All fees are due at the time of service or as otherwise agreed in writing. Payments are processed through secure, PCI-compliant payment processors. Refunds are considered on a case-by-case basis. Because our consultations involve significant preparation time, partial refunds may apply. No refund will be issued after a session has been completed.`,
  },
  {
    title: "Telehealth Consent",
    body: `By booking a virtual session with Pristine Functional Health, you acknowledge that you understand the benefits and limitations of telehealth services, including potential technology-related disruptions. You consent to the use of video conferencing technology for your consultations. You understand that Megha Shah may refer you to an in-person provider if telehealth is deemed clinically inadequate for your needs.`,

    body: `All content on this website — including text, graphics, logos, images, and educational materials — is the intellectual property of Pristine Functional Health and is protected by copyright law.
